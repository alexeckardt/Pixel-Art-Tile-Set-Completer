# Pixel-Art-Tile-Set-Completer
Python Script that, given 4 tiles, creates an entire set of tiles that can then be used in a platformer video game.

These outputted tiles are a  "rough draft", they are intended to be touched up by an artist later.

See ./infiles and ./outfiles for input and output examples.
